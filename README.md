# LiamFoxinator - Giving Dr Liam Fox MP his true title!

LiamFoxinator was a self-started project that was designed to serve two purposes: 
1. For me to learn how to program Chrome extensions
2. To make me, and others, laugh.

## What's it all about?

Liam Fox, the International Trade Minister at time of writing, is a Conservative MP who previously the Defence Minister. He left that post in disgrace after it emerged that he had taken his friend who didn't have appropriate clearance along to high-level meetings. Ever since then, he's been referred to as the "Disgraced Former Defence Secretary". 

The idea to create an extension to do this automatically came from a comment on a Reddit post. In the /r/UnitedKingdom subreddit, an article with Liam Fox's name in the title was posted and the top rated comment was a user reminding people to prefix his name with Disgraced Former Defence Secretary. Another user replied "there should be a Chrome extension for that", and I agreed.

The chrome extension uses Regex to replace mentions of "Liam Fox" and some variations to "Disgraced Former Defence Secretary Liam Fox". It got a bit of traction on reddit and on Twitter and at the moment has about [410 weekly users](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/liam-foxinator/neighkpnbclgljfgdmijhabhgifdhabn).
